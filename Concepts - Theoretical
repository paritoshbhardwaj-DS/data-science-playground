What is big data?
Certain elements are common like velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value
Velocity - speed at which data accumulates. Ex - every 60 sec data is uploaded on yt
Volume - increase in data stored. Ex - all the gadgets you use create huge datapoints
Variety - diversity of data Ex- text, picture, health, iot
Veracity - quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy. attributes include consistency, completeness, integrtiy, ambiguity. is the Ex - 80% data is unstructured 
Value - what value is derived just profit but medical, satisfaction etc.   

What are some common Big data processing tools?
Apache hadoop - collection of tools that provides distributed storage and processing of big data across clusters of computers (HDFS). Can incorporate new data formats. provides real time data access. 
                HDFS - storage system for big data. partitions file over mutiple computers allowing parallel processing. 
Apache hive - data warehouse for data query and analysis built on top of hadoop. Hadoop is intended for long sequential scans hence queries have high latency hence not suitable for faster response. 
              Better suited for data wh tasks such as ETL, reporting and data analysis. 
Apache spark - general purpose data processing engine designed to extract and process large volumes of data for a wide range of applications. Like - Interactive analytics, streams processing,ML, data integration and ETL
              Has in-memory processing which significantly increases speed of computations. processes streaming data fast and performs complex analytics in real time are good used cases. 

How does typical data mining process looks like ?
1. Goal set - identify key questions concerns aboust cost and benefit
2. Select data
3. Preprocess - clean the data, identify relevant attributes of data and identifying errors in data
4. Transform - determine appropriate format to staroe the data
5. Data mine - determine methods and analyze
6. Evaluate - evaluate outcome, test predictive capability, test effectiveness of the model and algorithm on the observed data and share results
