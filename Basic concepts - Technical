What are different file formats?
1. Delimited text file formats or .CSV or .TSV
2. Microsoft excel open or .XML or .XLSX
3. Extensible markup language or .XML
4. Potable document format or .PDF
5. JavaScript object notations or .JSON

1. Delimited text file formats --> Data is stored as text and each value is separated by a specific character called delimiter. Delimiter can be comma, tab, space, colon, pipe or semicolon. 
Delimiter defines boundary between independent values. 

3. .XML --> A well-organized filing cabinet with labels for every piece of data. 
Markup language with set rules for encoding data and is self descriptive language readable by both machines and humans. 
<employee>
  <name>Alice</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <city>Bangalore</city>
</employee>

Pros- sharing structured data between systems and can handle complex relationships
Limitations - very wordy as lots of tags, slower to process compared to csv or json. 

5. .JSON -->  A neat shopping list with categories and sub-items. text based open standard design for transmitting data over the web. Language independent and easy to use. 

{
  "employee": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Bangalore"
  }
}
